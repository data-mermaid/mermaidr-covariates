#> - title: MEOW Boundaries
#> - description: 
#> This dataset combines two separately published datasets: the "Marine Ecoregions Of the World" (MEOW; 2007) and the "Pelagic Provinces Of the World" (PPOW; 2012). These datasets were developed by Mark Spalding and colleagues in The Nature Conservancy. Alongside the individual authors, partners for the MEOW layer included WWF, Ramsar, WCS, and UNEP-WCMC. The ecoregions and pelagic provinces are broadly aligned with each other and are non-overlapping.
#> 
#> The MEOW dataset shows a biogeographic classification of the world's coastal and continental shelf waters, following a nested hierarchy of realms, provinces and ecoregions. It describes 232 ecoregions, which lie within 62 provinces and 12 large realms. The regions aim to capture generic patterns of biodiversity across habitats and taxa, with regions extending from the coast (intertidal zone) to the 200 m depth contour (extended beyond these waters out by a 5 km buffer).
#> 
#> The PPOW dataset shows a biogeographic classification of the surface pelagic (i.e. epipelagic) waters of the world's oceans. It describes 37 pelagic provinces of the world, nested into four broad realms. A system of seven biomes are also identified ecologically, and these are spatially disjoint but united by common abiotic conditions, thereby creating physiognomically similar communities.

#> - title: Human Pressures and Climate Vulnerability
#> - description: 
#> This dataset combines climate vulnerability scores and human pressure indicators for coral reefs worldwide. It integrates data from Beyer et al. (2018) on climate vulnerability and Andrello et al. (2022) on local human pressures.
#> 
#> Climate vulnerability scores include overall vulnerability, current niche, current year, projected future climate, thermal history, and temperature range metrics. Human pressure indicators include sedimentation, nutrients (nitrogen), coastal population within 5 km, market gravity (fishing pressure), number of ports, reef value, and cumulative human pressure index.
#> 
#> The dataset provides both normalized indicator values and raw values for key pressure metrics, along with regional classifications and BCU (Bioclimatic Unit) designations.
